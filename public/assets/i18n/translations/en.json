While performing she sends you to the â€˜Blues Planetâ€™ with her HUGE vocal talent and natural charm that both mystically linger in the corners of your mind.

Memphis is an immense city with a rich musical past and presence. It is also where MS Nickki has lived for over 20 years now. Her major musical influences were:  The Queen of The Blues Denise LaSalleðŸ‘‘, Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin, Miss Koko Taylor, B.B. King & Tina Turner; as well as artists from Memphis and the surrounding areas such as Bobby Blue Bland, Johnny Taylor and Al Green.",
