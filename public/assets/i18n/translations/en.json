She sends you to the Blues planet with an impressive vocal talent and a natural charm that cannot leave you indifferent...<br/> MS Nickki sings a deep blues combining the power of gospel (a repertoire she knows particularly well) and the sweetness of soul: a musical alchemy typical of Memphis, Tennessee, this immense city with a rich musical past in which she has lived for ten years.<br/> Her major influences are singers such as Denise LaSalle , Aretha Franklin, Tina Turner, Barbara Carr and singers from Memphis such as Johnnie Taylor and Al Green.",

Dublin Blues Festival (Ireland), Blues Rules Festival (Switzerland) and many others. On stage, it's a shock wave that spreads! She loves to sing and share her love for the Blues and Life!
